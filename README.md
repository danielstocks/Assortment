# Assortment

This is an experiment inspired by [The Sound of Sorting](http://panthema.net/2013/sound-of-sorting/). It's built with HTML5 Canvas/Web Audio/RequestAnimationFrame API's. Therefor it's likely to break in anything other than the latest version of your browser.


## Demo
The experiment can be viewed at [http://webcloud.se/Assortment](http://webcloud.se/Assortment) which is running the gh-pages branch of this repository


## Acknowledgements
The JavaScript sorting algorithms being used in this project are based on the work of [Nicholas C. Zakas](http://www.nczonline.net/about/). Take a look at his [computer-science-in-javascript repository](https://github.com/nzakas/computer-science-in-javascript). I also highly recommend reading his [blog articles](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/05/26/computer-science-in-javascript-bubble-sort/) on the subject.
